## Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
- Used RESTful API methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with weather and mock APIs.
- Applied JavaScript fetch API for making HTTP requests.
- Managed UI updates dynamically based on API responses.
- Used modular code for handling different API operations.
- Implemented a tabbed interface for better user experience.

## Reflection

### What I Learned
- Learned how to use fetch to call external APIs and handle JSON data.
- Understood the difference between GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- Improved skills in DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
- Practiced error handling for failed API requests.

### Challenges Faced
- Faced issues with CORS errors and API key restrictions.
- Sometimes the weather API did not return data for some cities.
- UI did not update correctly after editing or deleting a location.

### How I Overcame Challenges
- Read API documentation and checked for correct endpoints and parameters.
- Used browser console to debug errors and see failed network requests.
- Refreshed the page and re-tested after fixing code.
- Searched online for solutions to CORS and fetch-related problems.
