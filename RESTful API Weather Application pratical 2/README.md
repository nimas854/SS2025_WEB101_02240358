# RESTful API Weather Application (Practical 2)

This project is a Weather API Dashboard that demonstrates RESTful API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using JavaScript and HTML.

## Features

- **GET**: Fetch current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **POST**: Save a new location (city, country, notes) using a mock API (JSONPlaceholder).
- **PUT**: Edit/update saved locations.
- **DELETE**: Remove saved locations.
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation between features.

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- You need a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
- Internet connection is required for API requests.

### 2. Setup

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the folder `RESTful API Weather Application pratical 2`.

### 3. Running the App

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the tabs to:
   - **GET Weather**: Enter a city name and click "Get Weather" to see current weather.
   - **POST Location**: Fill in the location details and click "Save Location" to add it.
   - **Saved Locations**: View, edit, or delete your saved locations.
   - **API Info**: See information about the APIs used and last request details.

### 4. Notes

- The app uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data.
- Saved locations are managed using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a mock REST API.
- No backend setup is required; everything runs in the browser.

## Troubleshooting

- If weather data does not load, check your internet connection.
- Make sure you are not blocking API requests in your browser.
- For any issues, refresh the page and try again.
