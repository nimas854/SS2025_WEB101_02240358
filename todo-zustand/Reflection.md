## Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
- Used React for building the UI and component structure.
- Applied Zustand for global state management of todos.
- Used Zustand's persist middleware to store todos in localStorage.
- Implemented actions for adding, toggling, removing, and clearing todos.
- Used functional components and React hooks for state and events.

## Reflection

### What I Learned
- Learned how to use Zustand for simple and scalable state management.
- Understood how to persist state in localStorage using middleware.
- Practiced writing modular and reusable React components.
- Improved skills in handling user input and updating UI reactively.

### Challenges Faced
- Faced issues with state not persisting after page reloads.
- Sometimes todos were not updating correctly after actions.
- Styling and aligning components for a clean UI was tricky.

- Used browser dev tools to debug state and localStorage.
- Refactored code to ensure state updates were immutable.
- Tested the app after each change to confirm fixes.
